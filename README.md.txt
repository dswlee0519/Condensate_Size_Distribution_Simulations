This is a repository of MATLAB scripts by Daniel SW Lee associated with the manuscript "A rich get richer effect governs intracellular condensate size distributions" published on Bioxriv on March 10, 2022, and all subsequent versions of this manuscript. It contains code which implements Monte Carlo simulations of phase-separated condensates which merge upon collision and allows for the implementation of subdiffusive trajectories and gradual injection of material ("MergeSimFunFINAL"). Also included are codes for the convenient generation of batch scripts to sweep through parameters ("BatchFileWrite") and then to parse .csvs produced in the simulations into a simple matlab workspace ("sim_parse_workspace_output"), which may then be read into "workspace_parse_function" to produce distribution statistics. Contact danswlee@gmail.com with any questions or concerns. This text and repository will be updated as the manuscript proceeds through the publication process and is subject to change.
